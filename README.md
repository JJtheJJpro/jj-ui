# JJ's Linux UI Desktop
## Current State: Working on Front-end

JJ's Linux UI Desktop isn't only a desktop, it's a full-packed program that handles a vast majority of executables and files.

The plan for this project is to create my own Linux distro (first an extended shell using Ubuntu 64-bit and Debian 32-bit, then later a seperate distro) that has supportive capabilites with updating drivers, running a vast number of executables, and reading, writing, and parsing all sorts of files.
